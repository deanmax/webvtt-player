00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.250
Document deep south

00:00:07.251 --> 00:00:15.710
Los fields of cotton some

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:19.270
forests and factories in the heart of Dixie.

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:24.210
A revealing story of progress pioneering spirit documented with

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:29.160
on the spot recordings and produced by the radio broadcasting services extension

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:33.890
division. University of Alabama. For the next 30 minutes

00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:39.220
he will make a transcribed trip through the Deep South. You will see the significance of

00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:43.450
a new industrial south a changing South.

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:48.120
You will see how determined people are nature&#39;s plug into prosperity a

00:00:48.121 --> 00:01:05.690
move that more than ever is making itself felt in our nation&#39;s economy.

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:09.090
Black. A study in oil.

00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:27.770
You&#39;re an average American. You own a car or drive one as a consequence

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:32.370
have cause to use oil and gas in Alabama there&#39;s another average

00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:37.290
American who owns and operates an automobile. He too is concerned with the value

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:42.160
of oil and gas but his concern is borne of a deeper understanding or

00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:47.090
deeper knowledge of petroleum and its production. You have the pleasure of meeting

00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:48.020
him.

00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:52.890
Well to be Joe on stage just evolved and state oil and gas

00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:59.280
are much interested in petroleum you

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:04.000
know the petroleum industry is not yet 100 years old

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:09.470
oil was first discovered and well at Titusville

00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:14.410
Pennsylvania in 1859 and yet in less than

00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:18.890
a hundred yes it has grown to a point where we

00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:23.720
absolutely depended on it. Now the. Picture

00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:29.780
in the south. Is of deep interest to all of us.

00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:34.100
We produce about one seventh of the total

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:39.570
of the US. A good many of us States are just beginning production.

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:44.460
A good many of our states are just beginning production lesson

00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:49.330
number one. You learned at the South the same south that in recent years

00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:54.060
has soared to unbelievable heights in the petroleum industry. Today stands on the

00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:58.970
threshold of an even more fabulous future. You learn that there are more than

00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:03.760
32000 producing wells in eight of the Deep South states in

00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:08.430
Alabama in Arkansas and Florida Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi

00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:13.090
Tennessee and Virginia. You learn also that in 1951

00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:17.390
four thousand four hundred thirty nine new wells were drilled

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:22.560
pursuit of a promise. But sometimes that

00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:27.490
promise isn&#39;t fulfilled and the attempt ends with disappointment in a dry

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:32.430
hole. Now the 1951 ventures nearly 2000

00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:37.720
nearly one half of the attempts made it ended in this disappointment.

00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:42.650
But how about the 2000 wells and more that came through that this day are adding to the

00:03:42.651 --> 00:03:47.330
annual production of more than three hundred and 11 million barrels of crude oil from down Dixie

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:52.000
way. How about a promise that is kept alive by a productive past.

00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:59.060
You&#39;d like to know more about petroleum about its men and its methods how it&#39;s produced how

00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:02.500
it&#39;s processed what it means.

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:07.170
So you decide to take a trip so that up on the plea is we have a

00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:12.240
long trip coming up your where Dr Jones you&#39;re in his car as you pull out

00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:17.140
of the service station and head southward. It depends on where you are what route you

00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:22.130
take. But the destination is the same. If you brush the Ozarks then you&#39;re likely to

00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:27.420
pass an oil field in Arkansas. If you come to Kentucky you can&#39;t miss it.

00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:32.870
But let&#39;s say that you followed the Atlantic coast as you are now swinging inland and down into the Gilbert

00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:34.900
town area of Alabama.

00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:45.020
You can even hear pumping Jacks pumping black gold from beneath Alabama earth.

00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:49.890
You drive on with it past cotton fields that have come to live past progress in the

00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:54.840
making. You swing along the Gulf Coast past marshlands past ocean

00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:59.210
playgrounds past shrimp fleets and hopeful fisherman.

00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:10.840
And then at length you enter the Neckar of Mardi Gras.

00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:15.740
Your old busy body its rich Raymonds and revelry of the

00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:19.950
French Quarter and find. It ran

00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:36.370
great.

00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:41.020
And yet within the city of serious

00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:45.640
business at hand and in building modern and new

00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:49.640
work plotting new courses for constructing a final future

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:55.800
inside a tall shapely young lady operates the elevator. You step out of the fourth

00:05:55.801 --> 00:06:00.360
floor and follow Dr. Jones down the corridor. You are should into a nice room a

00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:03.320
comfortable office. Dr Jones explains your visit.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:13.740
Leading state and production of oil and gas

00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:20.320
and leave town and here to southern Louisiana.

00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:24.930
To see why this is so. We have

00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:29.890
time to go out just because we believe that. As division

00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:34.780
geologist you will know the story and we have come

00:06:34.781 --> 00:06:35.940
here to find it out.

00:06:35.941 --> 00:06:40.720
Now what about this thing that a geologist on the

00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:45.330
office wall there is a map of southern Louisiana

00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:49.880
showing all of the all the gas field and yes Richo are probably

00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:55.710
you look at the world map now laced with slanting lattice like shadows.

00:06:55.711 --> 00:07:00.550
The pattern of morning sun pouring through a Venetian blind from across the room.

00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:05.540
You see the colors red green yellow representative of various points

00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:10.450
of interest to want to man. The green for instance represents accumulations

00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:15.390
of oil the red gas you are told. And you

00:07:15.391 --> 00:07:19.720
remember the story about the first oil well in Louisiana that day in September

00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:24.650
1991 when but Moto driller W. Scott Haywood stood in that rice

00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:29.550
paddy near Jennings Louisiana wondering if a hunch and a hope would pay

00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:34.510
off. He drilled a thousand feet without success and obligated

00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:39.390
to drill another thousand foot Well I got permission to go deeper on that

00:07:39.391 --> 00:07:44.290
day at seventeen hundred feet. The bit struck oil sands the well was bailed

00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:48.790
out twice the second time a four inch column of oiled sawed over the

00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:53.740
derrick. This showed the way showed that it could

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:58.630
be done. That it was there to be had before

00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:03.410
you&#39;re on this huge wall map you&#39;re seeing up to the minute picture of today&#39;s all and gas

00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:08.320
operation in Louisiana. You see the clusters of pins representing drilling

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:13.320
operations covering the southern half of the state and stretching far out into the Gulf of

00:08:13.321 --> 00:08:18.040
Mexico. Why should Louisiana like its neighbor Texas be

00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:20.670
rich in our reserves.

00:08:20.671 --> 00:08:25.380
Well to some degree the answer is graphically shown in yellow the yellow color

00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:29.600
indicate location.

00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:34.600
Although you ask about salt domes and you find that as

00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:39.540
the name implies they are lifts and the Earth&#39;s surface hill like protrusion of

00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:44.300
salt pushing the earth upward in a rounded hump. Around these you find oil is

00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:49.830
usually found in quantity but how is oil actually discovered.

00:08:49.831 --> 00:08:54.810
The district geologist the man now seated across the polished desk tells you that it&#39;s a

00:08:54.811 --> 00:08:59.740
joint effort of the geologist and the geophysicist. The geologist.

00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:04.300
Well he might go about his work in one of three ways. The surface geologist

00:09:04.301 --> 00:09:09.390
the man who walks over the area looking for odd crops or surface indications of

00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:14.180
oil. Then there is the core drill geologist the man who drilled

00:09:14.181 --> 00:09:18.860
samplings sometimes as deep as fifteen hundred feet looking for underground

00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:23.840
indications. And finally the photo geologist the

00:09:23.841 --> 00:09:28.840
man who studies aerial photographs of the area searching for unusual drainage patterns

00:09:28.841 --> 00:09:34.020
and overall surface indications during the interview. Another man has come

00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.610
into the office.

00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:40.130
Dr Jones turns to him and I would visit you. This is due

00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:44.660
your division Your Business. What sort of

00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:48.590
work you doing in this area.

00:09:48.591 --> 00:09:53.090
Well it is just this is what we primarily look for is the

00:09:53.091 --> 00:09:57.670
structures that the geologists were referring to where they

00:09:57.671 --> 00:10:00.070
are will accumulate.

00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:04.950
You have to have these structures by the accumulation of the geophysicist is an

00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:09.780
important man in the search for a black girl and to aid him there are a

00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:14.770
number of instruments the magnetometer the gravity meter. You don&#39;t understand

00:10:14.771 --> 00:10:19.180
really but you listen carefully anyway. After all in the past 50 years

00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:24.060
Petroleum has played an important role in the changing South. Right now the

00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:28.980
geophysicists is telling you when Dr. Jones the most reliable method to seek out hidden

00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:33.000
reservoirs of oil is with an instrument called the seismograph.

00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:37.990
We consider the seismograph most reliable and you can see from the

00:10:37.991 --> 00:10:42.980
map there are blue pins all that well blue Pande

00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:46.340
going dad what those hands.

00:10:46.341 --> 00:10:52.300
How are those blue gander seismic crews here in southern Louisiana and what are the

00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:57.570
range ones scattered all over the map from one side to the other they aren&#39;t

00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:02.110
ones are the gravity crews or the peons.

00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:06.730
Sadly Chris about 80 in southern Louisiana at this

00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:11.600
time an active very average figure for the air and the severity of

00:11:11.601 --> 00:11:15.690
crew made around 20 pretty good things.

00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.570
Oh what do you do.

00:11:17.571 --> 00:11:22.100
Well what&#39;s involved in the equipment that is needed just how do you

00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:26.820
go about setting up for reading where the seismic crew

00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:32.400
well I&#39;ll just give an example of course it varies a lot with the equipment

00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:35.920
used to do the type of country and the terrain

00:11:35.921 --> 00:11:41.680
marsh or the swapper the lands there where you can have automotive

00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:46.380
equipment or in the marsh you used your swamp buggies or marsh

00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:51.240
buggies helicopters and various other means but generally

00:11:51.241 --> 00:11:56.720
what you do you. You bore holes with a smaller trail

00:11:56.721 --> 00:12:01.680
you drill your holes into the earth from varying death from 50 to

00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:06.660
several hundred feet and you place a charge of dynamite.

00:12:06.661 --> 00:12:12.980
Of course these are our understanding in a certain distance apart and

00:12:12.981 --> 00:12:18.020
surveyed in by your engineer civil engineer and you have your

00:12:18.021 --> 00:12:24.750
sensitive estimate set out on the ground when you stow charge of dynamite why

00:12:24.751 --> 00:12:29.720
it creates a small earthquake really and the seismic waves build out into the

00:12:29.721 --> 00:12:34.540
earth and on some particular Strattera buried in the earth they

00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:37.990
reflect back up this back yes it is a miracle.

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:42.910
You listen and you learn and you learn the principle of seismographs methods of

00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:47.470
exploring for oil. First the explosion.

00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:52.470
Shock waves travel. They ricochet on underground formations and bounce back to

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:53.780
the surface.

00:12:53.781 --> 00:12:58.500
These waves are impulses as a seismo crew would call them are recorded on very

00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:02.990
sensitive machines or seismographs and interpreter can take these readings

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:08.600
translate them into feet and create a geologic map of the area.

00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:13.510
We like to think that the seismograph. Something

00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:14.890
like this.

00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:19.880
Dr. Jones if you want to. You came down here to go fishing and

00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:23.020
you want to know where the best place to fish.

00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:27.970
We would say well if you&#39;re going to the best place but still

00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:30.350
it&#39;s always nice to contemplate.

00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:35.030
We would probably say five places here good but I would

00:13:35.031 --> 00:13:40.050
go here to Boggy Creek under the bridge to catch fish.

00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:46.610
That&#39;s the way we feel about the size.

00:13:46.611 --> 00:13:51.230
Ingenuity has invaded the deep sea men and machines tread a new path of

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:55.720
progress and science for the brightest sunrise for Dixie.

00:13:55.721 --> 00:14:00.620
You see this as these men of oil talk of their jobs tell you and Dr Jones

00:14:00.621 --> 00:14:04.900
what they do when the never ending search for black gold.

00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:09.840
Yes this is the land section Mr. Jones. The

00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:14.110
primary function of the land section is a purchase of all

00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:19.580
places an orgasm Oh it gives the

00:14:19.581 --> 00:14:24.080
company the right to enter up on the land and explore for oil and

00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:28.850
for him to Dr. Jones.

00:14:28.851 --> 00:14:33.810
The work of the geologist physicist and the land man is now

00:14:33.811 --> 00:14:38.000
complete. The location is ready for drilling and we&#39;re now

00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:43.700
ready to pass it on to the production department who will drill.

00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:48.390
I walk it well in the morning

00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:53.210
mist hovers over the bike blanketing a grotesque Cypress with a veil of

00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:58.040
damp. And dimly outlining the gray Spanish moss that drapes an

00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:02.700
eerie splendor on a cross bridges spanning winding

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:07.440
waterway alongside swamp shacks and shrimp boats and sugarcane

00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:08.720
fields.

00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:12.380
Get out early this morning. See a billion dollar industry.

00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:31.690
Going to twisting by road with an oil field. You see Derrickson

00:15:31.691 --> 00:15:36.340
drilling rigs more frequently. Sometimes jutting out of a clump of trees all the

00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:39.380
time squatting.

00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:43.260
And then you see why. See the oil boom I don&#39;t

00:15:43.261 --> 00:15:50.430
feel rising out of the fog.

00:15:50.431 --> 00:15:53.520
That one of the few that read it looks like.

00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:58.210
So don&#39;t get scared he&#39;d say find yourself in an open

00:15:58.211 --> 00:16:04.700
prairie saw grass and swamp water. On the horizon you see Derek&#39;s.

00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:06.630
Half dozen of.

00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:11.610
Your road. He brought it in dusty twist on what. Had links

00:16:11.611 --> 00:16:16.570
you come within several hundred yards of an oil derrick.

00:16:16.571 --> 00:16:18.550
You have reached your destination.

00:16:18.551 --> 00:16:27.390
So this is a raid. It looked like that. Place.

00:16:27.391 --> 00:16:32.080
Stopped as I. Caught a boat yesterday does it caught a boat

00:16:32.081 --> 00:16:36.540
out in a isolated marsh country we. Thank. Them was

00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:42.650
last week. Complete a week. Before they go back out to their homes.

00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:47.270
Or so. Take all the Mayos sleepier during that time.

00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:51.870
And how long do they stay all after that week. Like how many.

00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:57.910
Days before they come back in. They work five days and then two days.

00:16:57.911 --> 00:17:03.120
And. You run 24 hours.

00:17:03.121 --> 00:17:08.010
It doesn&#39;t make works around the talks and I&#39;m in live right on this lot of that on the quarter

00:17:08.011 --> 00:17:09.750
boat.

00:17:09.751 --> 00:17:14.250
We have three eight hour shifts each.

00:17:14.251 --> 00:17:18.760
From where you stand some distance from the derrick itself you can see the men moving

00:17:18.761 --> 00:17:23.650
about their Suba Hellmann&#39;s glistening in the sun. Later you will talk

00:17:23.651 --> 00:17:28.580
with these men. You will ask them how they feel about their job their family their

00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:33.390
future about the South and its place in the nation about their place in the

00:17:33.391 --> 00:17:38.120
south. They won&#39;t talk much and they&#39;ll find the first question

00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:42.840
easier to put into words. Were they close to their job. They like it

00:17:42.841 --> 00:17:47.680
because it&#39;s the one thing they know best because it&#39;s a living. And when you

00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:52.660
ask them about living and working in the desolate marsh country they hands it will be very simple

00:17:52.661 --> 00:17:58.990
makes it easier to concentrate on the job. Makes one better appreciate the off duty days.

00:17:58.991 --> 00:18:03.800
Besides the strenuous routine leaves little time for loneliness. And

00:18:03.801 --> 00:18:09.680
there&#39;s always the pride of achievement. The feeling of success when a whale comes in.

00:18:09.681 --> 00:18:14.660
And then there&#39;s the suspense. The hope the calm expect that mounts higher and

00:18:14.661 --> 00:18:19.280
higher as the drill bores deeper and deeper. But most rough

00:18:19.281 --> 00:18:24.170
mixes these men are called narrow their concern to the confines of their own

00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:28.990
Vajra meant seemingly unaware that their success means a fortune

00:18:28.991 --> 00:18:32.100
and a future for the south of the nation.

00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:38.320
Now that big steel out in front of.

00:18:38.321 --> 00:18:43.130
The line it has a derrick on it. Is that normal situation for

00:18:43.131 --> 00:18:45.090
this. I think.

00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:49.790
It is from the marsh country. That is a barge that carries all organic

00:18:49.791 --> 00:18:54.670
machinery. A lot plans to fire up right drag the

00:18:54.671 --> 00:18:57.450
dark horse in the pipe out of the hole.

00:18:57.451 --> 00:19:01.130
Well. They&#39;re not Grayling that at the moment

00:19:01.131 --> 00:19:06.540
racking pipe. In the rig. What&#39;s that.

00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:12.690
Pulling the bell pipe out of the hole to. Put on a new bed to bed at alland I was.

00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:17.610
When I went to this well stocked this towel I started 37 days ago and how deep is

00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:22.170
12000 feet two miles what&#39;s it done with the.

00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:26.870
Clavicle ranges. That

00:19:26.871 --> 00:19:31.200
sadly at what depth do you think you&#39;re going we expect to go in depth approximate

00:19:31.201 --> 00:19:35.660
16000 feet. Let it be deep enough for anything.

00:19:35.661 --> 00:19:40.300
That&#39;s the assistant division superintendent talking telling you and Dr Jones

00:19:40.301 --> 00:19:44.650
how black gold is brought forth from the desolate marshlands of Louisiana.

00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:51.440
You discover that the delicate self towering A hundred and thirty six feet in the areas located

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:56.420
on a movable barge at the steel barge is anchored into place by pumping water into its

00:19:56.421 --> 00:20:01.270
compartments and sinking it. It&#39;s customary to get to these locations about boats you

00:20:01.271 --> 00:20:06.170
find at the twisting road you came over was an unusual luxury not common

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:08.900
place in Cajun country.

00:20:08.901 --> 00:20:13.820
You follow Dr. Jones across the narrow pier like Plank way too are they all well.

00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:18.710
The roar of the the constant wind is deafening. You walk near a watchful of your

00:20:18.711 --> 00:20:23.520
footing. You strain upward you see a mammoth pulley moving up the

00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:27.620
center of the derrick drawing after it a seemingly Sandy straw like section of.

00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:32.310
I get told that it&#39;s brought out of the hones reattached joint

00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:37.970
each joint measuring 30 feet in length at the top of the darker one and in the silver helmet

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:43.110
pushes a 90 foot long sections of pipe into a room where they are right. It&#39;s

00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:47.370
long hard dangerous work and it&#39;s a gamble. A

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:52.510
multimillion dollar again someday this project financed.

00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:56.680
They know how and efficiency more than likely pay off

00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:59.850
at least that&#39;s the hope.

00:20:59.851 --> 00:21:04.770
The old man&#39;s prayer feeling

00:21:04.771 --> 00:21:08.230
is rolling along strangled ground by a lot of them

00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:14.010
already had a great deal stacked. Flat in their way.

00:21:14.011 --> 00:21:17.660
You know something.

00:21:17.661 --> 00:21:23.400
Oh then.

00:21:23.401 --> 00:21:28.170
And now. Maybe he can tell us something about it. What is your

00:21:28.171 --> 00:21:33.940
job here in the ring. What are they doing.

00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:38.640
We are changing the old one is

00:21:38.641 --> 00:21:41.620
alone is it. You have one on.

00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:48.630
Yeah that is correct. Which involves running our home.

00:21:48.631 --> 00:21:53.560
I&#39;m out of steel stacked up in this hole must be put in BBR only

00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:58.390
brought me home and then the long operation.

00:21:58.391 --> 00:22:02.980
Yes it is but I&#39;ll be happy to do that when the

00:22:02.981 --> 00:22:07.820
present be at we are running we have approximately every

00:22:07.821 --> 00:22:09.060
16 to 20 hour.

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:14.380
Painting on a harness formation is not a matter of getting in and

00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:19.890
making a hole all the time. You got a whole lot of other way to go.

00:22:19.891 --> 00:22:24.750
The drill like you must be the boss. Yes I am this

00:22:24.751 --> 00:22:29.730
particular talent talent but what does that mean.

00:22:29.731 --> 00:22:34.750
We want to call him and all the time to work.

00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:40.170
We call them talent and we were able hammy to me and you have to help him.

00:22:40.171 --> 00:22:46.540
I am a man but what do they have what do they do.

00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:51.310
We have one man and a Mechanic Man which we

00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:56.230
employ the man would know the duty such as handing changing

00:22:56.231 --> 00:22:57.690
beds and whatnot.

00:22:57.691 --> 00:23:02.350
Later you meet one of these men to face to face. He&#39;s young

00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:09.160
he&#39;s strong he&#39;s modest.

00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:14.140
What&#39;s your job here on the road.

00:23:14.141 --> 00:23:17.670
Rough rough next round.

00:23:17.671 --> 00:23:22.590
Good to see that you&#39;re coming out of the hole now with the

00:23:22.591 --> 00:23:28.950
long sections of steel pipe. How long can that take in a moment.

00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:33.920
This line that&#39;s become completely out how long to take it slowly

00:23:33.921 --> 00:23:38.920
like that. And then when you

00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:43.770
get the drill bit on that whole thing it&#39;s got to be done in rebuttal and go

00:23:43.771 --> 00:23:48.650
down the bottom again. And that&#39;s why you could very easily spend

00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:53.350
one towel just banging a pipe out of the hole is that this

00:23:53.351 --> 00:23:55.550
step and get it back in again

00:23:55.551 --> 00:24:01.810
and resting. Thank you very much.

00:24:01.811 --> 00:24:06.800
You follow the men into the corner book. Inside you find a 4 table mess hall and a

00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:11.720
feast for a king. These roughnecks have rough work and as a consequence

00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:17.550
they eat hearty. But it takes brains as well as brawn to bring in a well.

00:24:17.551 --> 00:24:22.480
For instance this young man yes or production

00:24:22.481 --> 00:24:24.500
geologist in this district.

00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:34.590
My job is. In conjunction with our division.

00:24:34.591 --> 00:24:39.430
Decider jelling programs on. The wells in my district. Which is

00:24:39.431 --> 00:24:44.430
sad day to tell them where to log the wells ideas

00:24:44.431 --> 00:24:49.970
write electrical surveys where to core the wells and.

00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:54.930
Things of that manner. No it isn&#39;t and haphazard job

00:24:54.931 --> 00:25:00.420
even though it is a gamble. And even after the job is completed a watchful eye

00:25:00.421 --> 00:25:05.180
is kept on this valuable naturist sauce. You meet the man who keeps this watch

00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:07.250
a petroleum engineer.

00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:12.670
Yes I&#39;m the petroleum engineer. My duties just primarily.

00:25:12.671 --> 00:25:17.640
Of. Assisting in the drilling and completion. And producing of all

00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:23.010
wells. And the study of the reservoir from which the oil is withdrawn.

00:25:23.011 --> 00:25:27.920
To determine the rates to produce these whales in

00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:32.370
order to obtain the maximum amount of all from these ratable is

00:25:32.371 --> 00:25:33.750
without waste.

00:25:33.751 --> 00:25:55.080
Well you visited an oil well in southern Louisiana and the nation&#39;s fourth

00:25:55.081 --> 00:25:59.880
highest produced petroleum. You could say this well is typical

00:25:59.881 --> 00:26:04.760
it is of marshland drilling and someday someday soon

00:26:04.761 --> 00:26:10.030
it will probably join its neighboring rigs and servicing the South&#39;s rich supply of black

00:26:10.031 --> 00:26:14.500
gold. Right now the biggest Oh but the

00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:17.240
future never looks so bright.

00:26:17.241 --> 00:26:21.960
One look at the national picture we&#39;ll show you why we had rusted and

00:26:21.961 --> 00:26:27.320
oil in the Deep South. We produced in the deep south one

00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:32.260
seventh of the total U.S. production and

00:26:32.261 --> 00:26:36.830
the 1951 cost Texas produced by one half

00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:42.130
of the U.S. total. Louisiana produces about three fourths of the

00:26:42.131 --> 00:26:46.710
total for the Deep South and is by far the

00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:51.830
most important producer at present in the Deep South. But

00:26:51.831 --> 00:26:56.810
all has just been discovered and Savile of the state and

00:26:56.811 --> 00:27:01.710
we have a feeling that petroleum in the south is definitely

00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:06.350
on the upswing the picture very bright there is increasing every

00:27:06.351 --> 00:27:11.290
day and we have a feeling that the best

00:27:11.291 --> 00:27:13.270
is yet to come.

00:27:13.271 --> 00:27:19.120
Once more you travel over the twisting deep broad road once more you

00:27:19.121 --> 00:27:23.750
pass a salt dome and allow Derek&#39;s shrimp boats by use

00:27:23.751 --> 00:27:29.270
once more you&#39;re heading home and wherever you go or whatever you put into a service

00:27:29.271 --> 00:27:33.090
station and say oh I&#39;ve got a long trip to meet.

00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:37.880
You were north of the Deep South is helping to fill your tank. Or it too is making a

00:27:37.881 --> 00:27:50.800
long trip. Toward. Prosperity.

00:27:50.801 --> 00:27:52.640
It was. The.

00:27:52.641 --> 00:28:08.640
This has been program eight of document Deep South a

00:28:08.641 --> 00:28:13.240
series of actuality documentaries depicting the increasing importance of the

00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:17.730
South and the economic development of our nation. This week

00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:22.600
black gold a study in oil. Your narrator was Walt
